## [1.4.0-rc.6] - 2022-10-20
1. support ambigious methods calling after generated staticwrapper. #1020
2. fix a bug that after blittablecopy staticwrapper generated, passing two or more struct from C# to a JSFunction will get wrong JS arguments #1018
3. fix Array Type arguments will cause error in staticwrapper #1015
4. refactor the template of wrapper and get a little performance improvement [report](https://github.com/puerts/PerformanceTesting/tree/build/States) 
5. add missing '--jitless' flag for ios PuerTS with nodejs backend

## [1.4.0-rc.2] - 2022-09-28
1. full platform support for Node.js (i.e. Android and iOS support added). upm package now uses Node.js Backend by default.
2. In order to make the Node.js function more convenient to use, and also to solve the problem of WebGL version in WeChat mini-game, from this version on, add global variables `CS` and `puer`, corresponding to the original `require('csharp')` and `require('puerts')`. Please change the using of `require` to `global.CS`, `global.puer`, `import 'xxx'`. The `require` in PuerTS will be considered to be removed in version 1.5.
3. Add `JsEnv.Backend` and add some GC API. `LowMemoryNotification` has moved into it too.
4. refactor `NodeRunner`
5. `ExecuteModule` handling of multi-level dependencies fixed.
6. GeneralSetterManager/GeneralGetterManager optimization #688
7. fix the bug that inspector break point + `setInterval` will cause crash #707
8. support multiple inspectors connection for one single JsEnv, `hotreload` can also be used with inspector at the same time now #841
9. remove `Node.js backend`'s `--no-browser-globals`
10. fix the problem that circular dependency will cause crash when loading ESM
11. fix the problem that ESM throws error when loading dependency with relative path
12. add `import.meta.url` when module is loading
13. fix the problem that dts reports an error when generating nullable types

## [1.3.0] - 2022-04-05
1. rearrange the directory layout to support UPM
2. Generator refactored. Generator is seperated to many small file now.

4. JSFunction::Invoke refactored，fix #681 。
5. Deleted some deprecated v8 calls. to make puerts compat with v8 8.4++。
6. New concept `LazyBinding`：
    In 1.3- when you write `return false` in filter for some c# member. That member will still do TypeRegist by reflection could be call during runtime.
    Now, this feature will still work. But that kind of member will do reflection during first invoke but not during TypeRegister.
 8. New form of `filter`
     To compat with the new `LazyBinding` mode. `Filter` now can not only return a boolean but can return a `BindingMode`. Which is a enum inculde `FastBinding` (means will generate static wrapper)、`LazyBinding` (mentioned above)、`DontBinding` (can not be called during runtime)。you can find an example in `U2018Compatible.cs`
