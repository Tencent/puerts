## What？

puerts is a TypeScript programming solution within game engines.

* provides a JavaScript Runtime

* allows TypeScript to access the host engine（module-binding on the JavaScript level and generating TypeScript declarations）

## Why?

* Facililates game building processes by combining JavaScript packages and toolchains with the rendering power of professional game engines

* In contrast to lua script, TypeScript supports static type checking, which significantly improves code robustness and maintainability.

* High efficiency: supports reflection binding throughout the platform (engine) - no extra steps (code generation) needes for development.

* High performance：supports static binding throughout the platform (engine) - takes care of complex scenes

## Installation

* git clone https://github.com/Tencent/puerts.git

* Copying the plugin to your project

    - unreal engine
    
        + copy `Puerts` under `puerts/unreal` to your project's `Plugins` folder - please refer to [unreal demo](https://github.com/chexiongsheng/puerts_unreal_demo)
    
    - unity
    
        + copy all contents under `puerts/unity/Assets` to your project's `Assets` folder - please refer to [unity demo](https://github.com/chexiongsheng/puerts_unity_demo)
        
        + Plugins needs to be either downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/Tencent/puerts/releases) or complied by yourself.

## Code samples

Unity

```typescript
import {UnityEngine} from 'csharp'

UnityEngine.Debug.Log('hello world');
let gameObject = new UnityEngine.GameObject("testobject");
console.log(gameObject.name);
gameObject.transform.position = new UnityEngine.Vector3(1, 2, 3);
```

Unreal

```typescript
import * as UE from 'ue'
import {argv} from 'puerts';
let world = argv.getByName("World") as UE.World;
let actor = world.SpawnActor(UE.MainActor.StaticClass(),
    undefined, UE.ESpawnActorCollisionHandlingMethod.Undefined, undefined, undefined) as UE.MainActor;
console.log(actor.GetName());
console.log(actor.K2_GetActorLocation().ToString());
```
