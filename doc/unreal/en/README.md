## What？

puerts is a TypeScript programming solution within game engines.
* provides a JavaScript Runtime

* allows TypeScript to access the host engine（module-binding on the JavaScript level and generating TypeScript declarations）

 

## Why?

* Facililates game building processes by combining JavaScript packages and toolchains with the rendering power of professional game engines

* In contrast to lua script, TypeScript supports static type checking, which significantly improves code robustness and maintainability.

* WebGL support. Much faster than lua in WebGL.

* High efficiency: supports reflection binding throughout the platform (engine) - no extra steps (code generation) needed for development.

* High performance：supports static binding throughout the platform (engine) - takes care of complex scenes
